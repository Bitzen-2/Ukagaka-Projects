Thank you for downloading Aaron!! 

He's the ghost i've been working on for Ghost Jam. I simply aimed to get him done in a week, on top of my usual routine. Since releasing him for Ghost Jam, I've finished all I aimed for him during the event, and even more outside of it.

His purpose is to talk to YOU! He loves to talk! Too much! He's very energetic, and will make sure you know he's fond of you. He's very bubbly, although will humble himself at times. He loves to meet new people like you!
 
He shares random thoughts, hobbies, opinions, puns, songs, and many more things. You, as the user, can ask him for certain things, like to talk about animals you like, or you can ask him for song recommendations, or you could simply annoy him by petting him constantly, the possibilities are endless!

Have fun playing with Aaron!!
