# Welcome!!

Hi!

Before we get into downloading Aaron, let's **define what a Ukagaka is.**

A Ukagaka, or a 'ghost' as it's commonly referred to in English, is a small little desktop buddy! They can do many things like empty your recycle bin, change your background, fix your desktops clock, and much more*! However, many are simply focused on other things, like talking to you, playing games, getting to know you, and other things.
_*Note: Not every Ukagaka has these features. Depends upon what the developer has coded into them._

I've made my very own Ukagaka, Aaron the Protogen! He's pretty upbeat, friendly and is keen to meet you!

Throughout this guide, I'll show you how to download and use him!

## How To Download Aaron
First, you're gonna have to download a base program that will allow you to run a ghost. Ukagakas can't run simply on their own, unfortunately. It's not too complicated, though.
Depending on what operating system you have on your laptop/desktop, you'll have to download a different base software.

Mac Users: [Ukagakas On Macs](http://www14.big.or.jp/~ayase/ese/), [NiseRingo](http://ccm.sherry.jp/ninni/index.en.html), [PlayOnMac++SSP](https://tablesalt.o0o0.jp/ukagaka/ct_maconssp.html), [WineBottler](https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/)

Linux Users: [Ninix](http://ninix-aya.osdn.jp/), [Ninix-aya](https://thanks.yahoo.co.jp/)

Windows Users: [SSP](http://ssp.shillest.net/)

This tutorial will be focusing on SSP for Windows, as I haven't tested out any other programs. 

Once you click on the link, something similar to this should pop up.

You're gonna wanna click on the button on the left that reads "Complete Install Package"

It should download, go ahead and install it. Your computer may block you from downloading it, or your firewall may block it. Trust me, *it's not malware*, you're safe to download it. Bypass the warning and download & install SSP.

Your taskbar should have a bell icon pop up, that's SSP. I'd reccommend pinning it to your taskbar as it's kinda annoying to go though your files constantly to open up SSP over and over.

Once that's done, you can open it up and a catgirl, Emily, and bunny may pop up. Don't worry much about them. Any menus that pop up you can close, it'll be fine. Hold shift to speed through her dialogue. 

Right-click on Emily and check that the menu is in English, if it isn't, select the fourth option from the bottom and select English.

Emily will continue to speak Japanese, but as long as the right-click menu is in English, you're all set.

Next, you can download [Aaron's .nar file by clicking here and downloading the file.](https://github.com/Bitzen-2/Ukagaka-Projects/blob/main/U_Aaron_1.2.nar). Once it's finished downloading, drag and drop the file onto Emily, the catgirl. She should download Aaron for you. If something isn't right, you may have to manually extract Aaron yourself. Read past to the troubleshooting section if that's what's happening to you. That shouldn't happen, though. 

If you've successfully downloaded Aaron, congrats! Now all you gotta do is right-click on the catgirl, and find the option in the menu that reads "change ghost". Click on that and select "Aaron".

If his speech bubble isn't showing up like it is in those pictures, just right click on Aaron, and find the option that says 'balloon'. Click 'Red_Balloon'. 

If the font is a bit off, don't worry either. Open SSP in your files (It should be named something like ssp_2_4_90f, and it should be wherever you downloaded it), and open 'balloon' > 'u_aaron_balloon_2'. Search for a font that's named "KGCornerOfTheSky.ttf". Double click on that and click "install". Close and open up Aaron and his speech bubble should be as it is in the pictures.


## Troubleshooting

If for some reason, Emily won't install Aaron, you're gonna have to do it manually. Don't fret! it's not too difficult.

OPen up your downloads, and change the file extention of "u_aaron_1.2.nar" to "u_aaron_1.2.zip". Your computer may stop you from doing this, but go through with it anyway, it won't do any damage. 

You should be able to access the file now. Double click on it and open it up. There should be an option up top to 'extract all'. Press that and press browse on the pop-up that ensues. Find a folder on your computer names something similar to "ssp_2_4_90f". Go into that folder and go into the "ghosts" folder that follows. Extract all the files into there. 

Open up Emily and right-click on her and select the "change ghosts" option in the menu. It should come up with "Aaron" there. He should load up just fine after that. Congrats! You've downloaded Aaron! 

If his speech bubble is a bit weird, don't worry. You'll have to try fixing it manually. Right click on Aaron, and find the option that says 'balloon'. Click 'Red_Balloon'. If there's no option for that, go into the ssp folder, into 'ghost', 'u_aaron_1.2' and move the folder that reads 'u_aaron_balloon_2' into the 'balloons' folder, found back in the ssp folder.

If the font is a bit off, don't worry either. Open SSP in your files (It should be named something like ssp_2_4_90f, and it should be wherever you downloaded it), and open 'balloon' > 'u_aaron_balloon_2'. Search for a font that's named "KGCornerOfTheSky.ttf". Double click on that and click "install". Close and open up Aaron and his speech bubble should be as it is in the pictures.

## How To Use Aaron

Once Aaron has finished his introduction dialogue and rambling about animals, you can play around with him! Double click on him to bring up the main menu.

As you can see above, this menu has everything. Feel free to mess around with his menu, and mess with him to see how he reacts. Press 't' to get him to say something random. Right-click on him and select "close" to close him. 

Thank you for reading! Have fun with Aaron :DD
