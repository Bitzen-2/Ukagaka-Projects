//---------------------------AI Talk--------------------------
//Alright, this is it! The bread and butter of your ghost. This is where all their random conversations are stored. Of all the .dic files, this is the one you will probably be adding stuff to and updating the most as new dialogue comes to your mind. It is relatively simple in that there aren't many functions or real coding involved with this file, but there are a few cool tricks you can do within randomtalk that can make dialogue with interesting effects, so I'll point them out as we go along.
//I'm going to leave a lot of examples of different types of dialogue in here that you can study if the possibilities they present intrigue you. Study them carefully!

//Make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!

//--AiTalk
//Leave this alone.
//Advanced users, this is mostly setting up whether or not dialogue is in a chain before it displays. Again, you can leave it alone unless you want to screw around with chains for some strange reason.

//--RandomTalk 
 //Alright, here we go! This is where ALL your ghost's random dialogue will go! These are the conversations that they'll have with you or each other that pop up depending on the talk rate defined in menu.dic (or if you ignored that, set in bootend.dic in the first boot, which would be every five minutes).
 
//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//These text boxes are meant for those who have an interest in expanding or using more complicated functions in their ghost. Also for my own reference in the future since I plan on using this template too, haha. If you have no interest in any of this and just want to keep things as simple as possible, feel free to skip these boxes.

//You CAN link to other pools of dialogue in RandomTalk using envelopes/functions, such as %(teatalk) to pull from a pool of dialogue about tea. Then you'd just add that line in among the other dialogue in here with %(teatalk). However, this vastly lowers the probability of dialogue in that function being called. If teatalk only gets called 1/5 times, and it has 10 pieces of dialogue in there, then you're only getting... uh... god, I'm bad at fractions... 1...50th? a chance that a certain teatalk line will appear. LOOK THE GIST IS THAT THE PROBABILITY GETS LOW. This applies to any kind of dialogue in a conditional. A simpler example would be if you have one piece of normal dialogue, and one piece that's an if check that has four pieces of dialogue in there. You'd end up with a 50% chance to get that normal dialogue, and a 50% chance for ONE of the other four pieces of dialogue... which makes the odds of seeing any specific line in that special dialogue that much lower.

//You can't do things like put OnSystemBoot or something in RandomTalk. You could use \![raise] to pull something though, although I'd be careful about it. More on these kind of things and conditionals in general in the coding page on the walkthrough.

//If you split up RandomTalk with if/else checks, then you can redirect in an If to another function, like... if chargermode == "on" { ChargerChatting } else {normal random talk dialogue}. This would redirect the random dialogue to ChargerChatting instead. You can't just throw a function into RandomTalk directly though, like "dialogue 1" "dialogue 2" OnFunctionname "dialogue 3", that kind of thing. You'll have to split it off into its own if or point to it with an envelope.

//You can do multiple ifs in RandomTalk if required... like an if for if a character is asleep, or if a third character is present, or if they're having a nervous breakdown, or if they're sulking. It depends! You can add a bunch of checks leading to specialized pools if you want. Just make sure you leave some normal dialogue in the last else for RandomTalk (unless you want to redirect that somewhere else with an envelope too... although that seems a bit redundant, honestly.)

	//After the if statement is done, you can continue with dialogue as normal. As you can see, you can move the ifs around in here, it doesn't really matter. You may want to stick them all in one place together if you want to keep track of them, or you can scatter them around your dialogue as you please. It's up to you. These two lines below are just normal random dialogue.

	//And here we're going to go back into ifs! You see, you can space out your ifs with normal dialogue if you want, as I just mentioned. Anyway, you can set up if statements to check for a lot of different things! One of the cooler ones I think are ones set to check for time. This one for example checks if the month is December.

If you don't want to do these, you can just delete this whole set of ifs down to the //--Double Envelopes section below.
	//You can also nest ifs within these, so you could check if it was the 25 of April in the morning for example. You can also add or take away dialogue from these as you like, so if you want to have five dialogue options for April or one for January, you can totally do that.

//**** OnSurfaceRestore *****************************************************************
//OnSurfaceRestore is a handy function. What this does is that after a short period of time, the ghost will go back to its default pose, so you won't have a ghost stuck in one expression for too long. It's also helpful if you've made one of the characters disappear using \s[-1] in dialogue and didn't bring them back at the end of it. This will do that for you.
//I'm going to comment out the if/else statements in this because the circumstances in which they'd come up seem pretty unlikely and unnecessary if you're just going to be making a simple ghost. You can just leave this function alone and move on if you want. However, if you do want to use them, just uncomment the lines by deleting the slashes and fill in the info as you need.

//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//You can put if statements in OnSurfaceRestore to make exceptions for certain poses, or to make sure that once they're in a certain pose, they stay in that pose. For example, if you turn my Hunter and Smoker ghost into eggplants, there's a check for the their eggplant pose numbers to make sure they STAY eggplants when OnSurfaceRestore is called.
//You can also use OnSurfaceRestore to clean up things that might be left on the screen, primarily from using p[number]\s[] to call up other objects or characters. Just make sure to add a p[number]\s[-1] to OnSurfaceRestore, and that should get rid of it each time the ghost cleans itself up.
//***********************************************************************

//Yet more stolen-- I mean, borrowed code. This time it's another minigame called higher or lower!! i've never heard of a game like this before. This code was written by yuyudev @ twitter (though I have made slight modifications), as stated below!
//A simple minigame where the ghost pulls from a deck of cards, and the user guesses whether the next card will be higher or lower from the top card. Call it using something like 
//\![*]\q[Play HOL,holgame]

//HOLPoints are used to give the player money, if your ghost has a money system. Take them out if you aren’t using one. Also, you’ll need to adjust the back menu portions of the code.

//I also used two envelopes to keep the code a little neater. Add these to your word dic.
